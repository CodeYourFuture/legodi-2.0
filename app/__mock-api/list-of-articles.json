The Refugee Convention is international law. It is translated into EU law as the Qualification Directive. This is part of UK law (though this is likely to change once the UK leaves the EU) under rules known as the Qualification Regulations. The definition of persecution in the Qualification Regulations (and any relevant case law) is what the Home Office should use to assess whether a person is at risk of persecution if removed from the UK.\r\n\r\nThe Qualification Regulations state:\r\n5.— (1) In deciding whether a person is a refugee an act of persecution must be:\r\n\r\n(a) sufficiently serious by its nature or repetition as to constitute a severe violation of a basic human right, in particular a right from which derogation cannot be made under Article 15 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms(1); or\r\n\r\n(b) an accumulation of various measures, including a violation of a human right which is sufficiently severe as to affect an individual in a similar manner as specified in (a).\r\n\r\n(2) An act of persecution may, for example, take the form of:\r\n\r\n(a) an act of physical or mental violence, including an act of sexual violence;\r\n\r\n(b) a legal, administrative, police, or judicial measure which in itself is discriminatory or which is implemented in a discriminatory manner;\r\n\r\n(c ) prosecution or punishment, which is disproportionate or discriminatory;\r\n\r\n(d) denial of judicial redress resulting in a disproportionate or discriminatory punishment;\r\n\r\n(e) prosecution or punishment for refusal to perform military service in a conflict, where performing military service would include crimes or acts falling under regulation 7 [exclusion clauses, see below]\r\n\r\n(3) An act of persecution must be committed for at least one of the reasons in Article 1(A) of the Geneva Convention [reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group]. \r\n    ",

    "fullContent": "An asylum claim should be based on a \"well-founded fear\" of persecution if you were returned to your country of origin/country of residence. This means you do not need to show that the persecution would definitely happen, but that there is a real risk it could happen.\r\n\r\nHaving been persecuted in the past does not necessarily mean you will get refugee status. You need to show there is a future risk.\r\n\r\nTo show this fear is well-founded, you will need to provide evidence.\r\n\r\nThe evidence that everyone has is their story – what has happened to you, what have you been threatened with, what has happened to your family/colleagues/people you know – do these things mean you are at risk? Why did you leave? Why can't you go back?\r\n\r\ntestimony\r\nIn most cases, the UK Home Office (the government department who makes the decision on your asylum claim), will not believe your story. If you are able to go to court and appeal the Home Office refusal of your claim, the judge may also not believe your story.\r\n\r\nTry and obtain other evidence to support your story. You should not wait for the Home Office or courts to say they do not believe you before you try and get evidence to support what you have said.\r\n\r\nAre there witnesses to things that happened to you? Have you got documents that prove any part of your story? These might include arrest warrants, court documents, letters from friends/organisations showing you are in danger. Is there newspaper coverage of an event you are talking about? Are there human rights reports that show the situation in your country is like you say it is? \r\n    ",

    "fullContent": "To qualify for refugee status, you need to show that the reasons for which you have been persecuted or will be persecuted come under one of the Refugee Convention grounds: reasons of race; religion; nationality; political opinion; or membership of a particular social group.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to specify or say in legal language which Refugee Convention grounds you are applying under. Your case may actually come under more than one of these grounds. You tell the Home Office your reasons for fleeing, and they then consider which grounds this comes under. If you feel you have been refused because they applied the wrong grounds, this could be challenged.\r\n\r\nNationality, race, and religion are relatively straightforward grounds (if often difficult to evidence), but imputed beliefs and particular social group require further explanation.\r\n\r\nImputed identity or beliefs: what people think you are or do\r\n“Imputed” identity or beliefs means what people think you are or do. What people think you are, or do, could put you at risk of persecution even if it’s not true.\r\n\r\nFor example, if your local community thinks or says you are a Christian or an atheist, this may put you in danger even if you are not actually a Christian or atheist. If your family and neighbours believe you are gay or lesbian, you might be at risk irrespective of whether you are gay or straight. You may not actually be a member of an at-risk political group, but someone might spread rumours that you are, to try and get you in trouble.\r\n\r\nImputed beliefs might be a factor if a family member or friend is politically active or a member of a religious minority, and it is assumed you also hold these beliefs (this often applies to women asylum applicants). It may be because you are a gay rights campaigner, and therefore would be at risk in a homophobic country because people assume you are gay. Or it may be that because of your lifestyle (for example, you are unmarried in a country/culture where this is unusual) people assume you are gay and you would be at risk of persecution because of that.\r\n\r\nImputed beliefs may be assumed because of where you live, the job you do, and many other things outside of your control.\r\n\r\nParticular social group (PSG)\r\nParticular social group is the most complicated area of the Refugee Convention grounds. This is because it is quite vague and can cover a variety of situations. This category is heavily reliant on case law to explain what it currently means. Case law is the body of available writings explaining the verdicts in a case, and is used to explain the meaning of laws and policy.\r\n\r\nGender and sexuality are not distinct Refugee Convention grounds but come under particular social group. Gender as a particular social group needs to be more narrowly defined than just \"being a woman\" or \"being a man\". A certain category of women or men who face gender-specific persecution may fall under this category, such as \"women at risk of domestic violence in Pakistan\".\r\n\r\nThe category of particular social group is particularly important when dealing with non-state actors of persecution (see below), because it can be argued by the Home Office that while a person may be at risk, it is not for a Refugee Convention reason; therefore the UK has no obligation to offer protection. This may include claims involving domestic violence, honour killings, and gang violence/blood feuds. \r\n    ",
